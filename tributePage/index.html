                <p>Boole was given his first lessons in mathematics by his father, a tradesman, who also taught him to
                    make
                    optical instruments. Aside from his father’s help and a few years at local schools, however, Boole
                    was
                    self-taught in mathematics. When his father’s business declined, George had to work to support the
                    family. From the age of 16 he taught in village schools in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and he
                    opened
                    his own school in Lincoln when he was 20. During scant leisure time he read mathematics journals in
                    the
                    Lincoln’s Mechanics Institute. There he also read Isaac Newton’s Principia, Pierre-Simon Laplace’s
                    Traité de mécanique céleste, and Joseph-Louis Lagrange’s Mécanique analytique and began to solve
                    advanced problems in algebra. <br>
                    <br>
                    Boole submitted a stream of original papers to the new Cambridge Mathematical Journal, beginning in
                    1839
                    with his “Researches on the Theory of Analytical Transformations.” These papers were on differential
                    equations and the algebraic problem of linear transformation, emphasizing the concept of invariance.
                    In
                    1844, in an important paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society for which he was
                    awarded the Royal Society’s first gold medal for mathematics, he discussed how methods of algebra
                    and
                    calculus might be combined. Boole soon saw that his algebra could also be applied in logic.</p>

                <dd><strong><em> Boolean algebra</em></strong>  is a division of mathematics that deals with operations on logical values and
                    incorporates
                    binary variables. <strong><em> Boolean algebra</em></strong> traces its origins to an 1854 book by mathematician George Boole.

                    The distinguishing factor of <strong><em> Boolean algebra</em></strong>is that it deals only with the study of binary
                    variables. Most
                    commonly Boolean variables are presented with the possible values of 1 ("true") or 0 ("false").
                    Variables
                    can also have more complex interpretations, such as in set theory. <strong><em> Boolean algebra</em></strong> is also known as
                    binary
                    algebra.</dd>
